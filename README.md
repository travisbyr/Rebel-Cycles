# Rebel Cycles

#### Objective

I created an ecommerce full stack web application to showcase my skills and knowledge of JavaScript. I created this project using React, MySQL and Express using node. My application provides users with a way of purchasing motorcycle related products. I have also setup Auth0 for user authentication. Although the project is just proof of concept and not every aspect of the application is functionally, the main parts are. Below is project finished.

#### Homepage

On the homepage the user has the option to purchase products , which are being showcased on this page. They are also provided with an introduction, as well as further contact details for more services.

For users to purchase items they must create an account and be logged in. To do this, I have configured Auth0 to handle user authentication. Below is what my other pages look like.
